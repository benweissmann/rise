src/ contains the default directory structure for EasyRubygame projects,
including the framework itself.

test/ contains a testbed. Running test.sh copies the current contents of
src/ into test/, then runs the test application. Note that becuase the
framework includes a default src/main.rb, the test application stores
its main.rb in test/new_main.rb. Make any changes there.
